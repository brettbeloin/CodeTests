Ode to C
By a Grateful Programmer

In a world of wrappers, layers deep,
Where modern code may fall asleep,
There lives a language, bold and free—
A timeless spark: the letter C.

No bloated class or interface,
Just memory in its rawest grace.
With pointers sharp and structs so neat,
You dance on RAM with agile feet.

The semicolons click in time,
Each function sings in terse design.
A header here, a macro there,
Control is yours—with utmost care.

You forge your tools, you shape your might,
No garbage man lurks out of sight.
You cast, you shift, you bitwise play,
Each cycle bent to your own way.

The stack, the heap—your closest friends,
You guard them well, lest logic ends.
A segfault warns, but once you've learned,
Your leanest code is rightly earned.

From Linux hearts to drivers lean,
C's in the core of every machine.
A language spare, yet full of fire—
It fuels both kernel and desire.

So here's to C, both old and wise,
With syntax clear and no disguise.
For those who code with guts and glee,
There is no joy quite like in C.
